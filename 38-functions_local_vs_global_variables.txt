38 - Functions: local vs. global variables

Notes
    * A variable declared in the main code is a global variable.
    * A variable declared in a function is a local variable.
    * A parameter is a local variable.
    * Global and local variables differ in their scope.
    * A global variable is "in the shadow of" a local variable when a variable is declared in both the main code and function.
