70 - Objects: Properties

Notes
    * Object properties can be assigned strings, numbers, or booleans.
    * To create a property now and assign it a value later, you can create it with a value of undefined.
        * object.property = undefined;
    * You can delete a property of an object.
        * delete object.property;
    * To check if a property of an object exists.
        * propertyExists = "market" in deal3;

        Things to notice:
        * You could use any legal variable name instead of propertyExists.
        * The keyword in asks, "The property market is in the object deal3-true or false?"
        * The property market is in quotes.
        * The object deal3 is not in quotes.
    
    * Reminder the result is either true or false when checking for a property of an object exists.
