61 - The DOM: Junk artifacts and nodeType

Notes
    * Some browsers interpret whitespace in markup as text nodes.
        * In HTML markup whitespace is created by some tabs, spaces, and carriage returns.
    * var nType = targetNode.nodeType;
    * If the node is a text node the value of nType is 3.
    * If the node is an element node the value of nType is 1.
    * You can see why the getElementById method is more popular with coders than tracing the DOM hierarchy.
        * But there are some things you can't do without working your way through the parent-child relationships of the DOM.
