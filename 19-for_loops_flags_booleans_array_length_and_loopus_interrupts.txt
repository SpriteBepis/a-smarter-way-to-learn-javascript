19 - for loops: Flags, Booleans, array length, and loopus interruptus

Notes
    * A flag is just a variable that starts out with a default value that you give it, 
    and then is switched to a different value under certain conditions.
    * Boolean values false and true.
    * Break is the keyword that stops a loop from continuing to loop.
