43 - Placing scripts

Notes
    * Generally, the best place for scripts, though, is at the end of the body section.
        * Why? This guarantees that CSS styling and image display won't get held up while scripts are loading.
    * <script></script> if JavaScript is added within the HTML file.
    * <script src="whatever.js"></script> if using a separate JS file, which is best practice.
