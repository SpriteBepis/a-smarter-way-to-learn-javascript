63 - The DOM: Getting a target's name

Notes
    * ".nodeType", if element, then 1, if text, then 3.
    * ".nodeName" to get the node name. 
        * In HTML, the name is usually given in all-caps, even if the markup is in lowercase.
        * e.g. P, DIV, SPAN, IMG, A, EM, TABLE, LI
    * If the node is a text node, the name of the node is aways #text - in lower-case.
    * ".nodeValue"
    * An element node like P or IMG has a name but no value.
        * If you try to assign an element node value to a variable, the variable will be assigned null.
            * null is not in quotes.
