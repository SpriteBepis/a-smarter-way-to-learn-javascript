87 - Exceptions: try and catch

Notes
    * Try and catch are always paired. Without try, an errior won't trigger catch.
    
    Some things to keep in mind:
    * The code inside the try and the catch blocks is wrapped in curly brackets.
    * The functional code inside the try block is indented.
    * The error parameter, in this case err, can take any legal variable name.
    * In this example, an alert displays when an error occurs.

    * The try and catch pair have limited usefulness.
    * Mainly useful for spotting variables that haven't been defined or, as in this case, errors that JavaScript interprets as variables that haven't been defined (undefined variables).

    try {
        var z = x + y;
    }
    catch (param) {
        alert(param);
    }
