36 - Functions: Passing them data

Notes
    * The variables in a function definition that catch the data passed to them by the calling code are called parameters.
    * The rules for naming parameteres are the same as the rules for naming variables.
    * When there are multiple arguments and parameters, the arguments and parameters(param) are matched up by their order.
