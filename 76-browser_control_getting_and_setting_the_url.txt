76 - Browser control: Getting and setting the URL

Notes
    * var whereWeAt = window.location.href;
        * current location, meaning whole URL address.
    * var theDomain = window.location.hostname;
        * only pulls the domain name, e.g. "www.a.com".
    * var thePath = window.location.pathname;
        * If the browser were on the home page the string "/" would be assigned to the variable.
    * var theAnchor = window.location.hash;
        * "#andanythingafterit" or if there is no anchor in the URL, the variable is assigned an empty string "".
    * Coding Alternatives to Be Aware Of
        * You can omit window. It's legal to use location.href, location.hostname, location.pathname, and location.hash.
        It's more common to include window.
        * You can omit href when you're detecting the URL. It's legal to use window.location, or simply location. (See above.)
        Including href is preferred for esoteric reasons.
        * You can use document.URL as an alternative to window.location.href.
