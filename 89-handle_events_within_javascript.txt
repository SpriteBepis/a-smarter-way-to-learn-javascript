89 - Handle events within JavaScript

Notes
    * Unlike the camelCase used for inline event-handling, the event name must be all-lowercase or it won't work. It's onclick not onClick, onfocus not onFocus, onsubmit not onSubmit 
    * Unlike inline event-handling, the function name following the equal sign isn't in quotes 
    * Unlike inline event-handling, there are no parentheses following the function name
