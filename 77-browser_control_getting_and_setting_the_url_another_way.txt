77 - Browser control: Getting and setting the URL another way

Notes
    * window.location.assign("http://www.me.com");
        * The statement directs the browser to the home page of me.com.
        * As with the window.location.href statement, you can make the URL as deetailed as you like.
    * Alternatively, window.location.replace(("http://www.me.com"); could be used.
        * But by using replace instead of assign, you interfere with the browser history.
    * window.location.reload(true);
    * window.location.reload(false);
    * window.location.reload();
        * All three statements reload the current page. If the argument is true, the statement forces the browser to load the page from the server.
        * If the argument is false or if there is no argument, the browser will load the page from the cache if the page has been cached.
    * Coding Alernatives to Be Aware Of
        You can use window.location.href = window.location.href or any of the abbreviated alternatives to reload the current page. The reload is faster,
        but it doesn't allow you to specify whether the browser reloads from the server or the cache.
        document.URL = document.URL doesn't work.
