25 - Strings: Replacing characters

Notes
    * .replace() - finds and replaces a string.
        * first string inside the parentheses is the segment to be replaced.
        * second string inside the parentheses is the segement to be inserted.
    * If you want to replace all instances, you must let JavaScript know that you want a global replace.
        * e.g. /text/g
        * In a global replace, you enclose the segement to be replaced by forward slashes instead of quotation marks, followed by g.
            * The segment to be inserted is enclosed by quotation marks just like a one-time replace.
