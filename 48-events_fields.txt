48 - Events: fields

Notes
    * Again, this is the not-recommended inline way to handle an event, using it as a stepping stone for learning more!
    * Email:<br>
    <input type="text" size="30"
    onFocus="this.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';"
    onBlur="this.style.backgroundColor = 'white';">
        * A slightly more professional approach would be to call functions that accomplish the same things.
    * 'onFocus' is the keyword for detecting that the user has clicked in a field.
    * 'onBlur' is the keyword for detecting that a field no longer has the focus.
