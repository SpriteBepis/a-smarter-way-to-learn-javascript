41 - while loops

Notes
    * The differences between for and while loops:
        * while establishes a counter outside of the parentheses and in the first line.
    * A while loop is organized along the same lines as a for loop.
        * Parentheses enclose the loop limiter.
        * Curly brackets enclose the code that executes.
        * The code that executes is indented 2 spaces.
    * Since any for loop can be translated into a while loop and vice versa, you can use whichever one you prefer.
