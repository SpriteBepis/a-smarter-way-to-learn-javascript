Notes
    * Things to think about:
        * The inner loop runs a complete cycle of iternations on each iteration of the outer loop.
        * You can have as many levels of nesting as you like.
        * A nested loop is indented 2 spaces beyond its outer loop.
    * The outer and inner loop do not share the same counter.
