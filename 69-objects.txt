69 - Objects

Notes
    * var variable = object.property;
    * Objects and properties used to assigning values to variables efficiently.
        * Properties are just variables that are attached to an object.
    * var plan1 = {
        name: "Basic",
        price: 3.99,
        space: 100,
        transfer: 1000,
        pages: 10
    };

    Things to notice:
        * The code begins like any variable definition, with the keyword var, followed by the object name, and then an equal sign.
        * But then, instead of a value, there's a curly bracket, whose twin comes at the end of the block.
        * Each property begins with a name, followed by a colon, and then a value.
        * Each property definiton except the last ends with a comma.
        * The closing curly bracket is followed by a semicolon, because of the equal sign in the first line.
