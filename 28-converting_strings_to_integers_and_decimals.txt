28 - Converting strings to integers and decimals

Notes
    * NaN means "Not a Number."
    * If you want to do any addition you must convert all strings to integers.
    * Oddly that's not the case with -, *, or /.
    * parseInt() drops off decimals without rounding.
    * parseFloat() is used to preserve decimal values.
