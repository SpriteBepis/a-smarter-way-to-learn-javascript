15 - Arrays

Notes
    * An array is a variable that can have multiple values (elements) assigned to it.
        * An array can be assigned any type of value that you can assign to ordinary variables.
        * Can even mix the different types in the same array (not that you would ordinarily want to).
    * Coders often prefer to make array names plural - cities instead of city, for example - since an array is a list of things.
